# Phishing-Awareness-Simulation
To simulate phishing attacks in a controlled environment to assess and improve user  awareness and response to social engineering threats. The project aims to identify  human vulnerabilities in cybersecurity and promote safe online behavior through  real-world phishing scenarios.

# Tools & Environment: 
- GoPhish (Open-source phishing framework)
- custom email templates
- SMTP server setup
- survey tools (e.g., Google Forms)
- reporting dashboards.

# Key Work Done:
-  Designed realistic phishing email templates mimicking common attack vectors 
(e.g., fake login pages, urgent alerts)
- Configured and deployed phishing campaigns using GoPhish targeting selected 
users within an organization or study group
- Monitored and recorded user interactions with phishing emails (link clicks, data 
submissions)
- Conducted post-simulation awareness surveys and feedback collection
- Analyzed behavior trends and identified patterns in susceptibility
- Developed training materials and best practice guidelines for phishing prevention

# Outcome: 
Revealed significant gaps in user awareness, with measurable rates of link clicks and 
data disclosure. Based on insights, created targeted cybersecurity awareness programs 
to educate users on identifying and avoiding phishing attempts. The project highlights 
the importance of user-centric defense strategies and helps foster a more 
security-conscious culture.
