# Gophish
For setting up the tools I did the setup in kali environment.

- sudo apt update
- wget https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/download/v0.12.1/gophish-v0.12.1-linux-64bit.zip
- unzip gophish-v0.12.1-linux-64bit.zip

It unzipped the file and it gave me a executable file gophish, which was on readme only, so i had to change it to a executable file.
- chmod +x gophish
  
Then run the executable file.
- sudo ./gophish
